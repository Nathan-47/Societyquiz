# What's your Society tool

### What I learnt
- Using URLSearchParams allows me to avoid hardcoding the category in the URL. This makes it simple to dynamically update both the heading and the grid cards on the results page, providing a smoother and flexible user experience when displaying the societies category displayed to the user. 

<br />

### Future Improvements
- Once the user has completed their quiz and is given their suited societies category such as Sport, general interest etc, the tool could then calculate the users answers and give the percentage of how likely it matches to the category given.
